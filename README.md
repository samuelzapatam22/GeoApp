That's how simple it is to use **GeoAPP**.

## Installation

- In the terminal of the `server` folder and in the `client` folder, run the following command to install server dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```
## Database
For this project, we will use a non-SQL (non-relational) database, with the MongoDB database engine. Here, we will store all the information about the countries that you will be able to create in the future.

For each country, you will store:
- code
- name
- capital
- currency
- languages
- continent.

To access the database, use the following link in Mongo Compass:
```bash
mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.sxdtfez.mongodb.net/GeoApp

```
## Usage
- To run the server, use the following command within the `server` terminal:
```bash
nodemon index.js
```
- Then, to open GeoApp, use the command in the `client` terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```
and select the link.


## Project Status
The project is still in development. In future versions, you will be able to implement functions to update and delete countries, thus interacting with them in a better way. We will keep you updated and informed ðŸ˜ƒ.
